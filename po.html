<h2 style="background-color:lightcyan;"> PROGRAM OUTCOMES</h2><br>
<p><strong>
1. Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization<br> 
to the solution of complex engineering problems.<br><br>
2. Problem analysis: ldentify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated<br>
conclusions using first principles of mathematics,natural sciences, and engineering sciences.<br><br>
3. Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that<br>
meet the specified needs with appropriateconsideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural,societal, and environmental
 considerations.<br><br>
4. Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, <br>
analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.<br><br>
5. Modern tool usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including<br>
 prediction and modelling to complex engineering activitieswith an understanding of the limitations.<br><br>
6.The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and <br>
cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.<br><br>
7. Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental <br>
contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.<br><br>
8.Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice.<br>
9.Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in<br>
 multidisciplinary settings.<br><br>
10. Communication: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at<br>
 large, such as, being able to comprehend and writeeffective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and <br>
 give and receive clear instructions.<br><br>
11. Project management and finance: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply<br>
 these to one's own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments.<br><br>
12. Life-long learning: Recognize the need for,and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning<br>
 in the broadest context of technological change.<br><br>
